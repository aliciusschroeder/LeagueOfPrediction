"""
This script uses the RiotWatcher API to gather a list of League of Legends Match-ID's. It follows these steps:

1. It starts by obtaining the unique identifier (puuid) of a summoner based on their name (considered as a seed).
2. Next, it retrieves the summoner's past matches using the get_past_matches function. The OLDEST_ALLOWED_DATE 
   variable defines the maximum date for considering matches.
3. The script extracts the puuid of all summoners who participated in the past matches and removes any duplicates 
   from the list.
4. It then iterates over the summoners and retrieves their respective past matches, appending them to the matches list.
5. Any duplicate match IDs are removed from the matches list.
6. Finally, the script writes the match IDs to a file named "manymatches.txt" by opening the file in "append" mode.

Depending on player-overlap you can expect around 9*n^2 match ids where n is the number of past matches you fetch
